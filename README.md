# FileTransferator
This is my biggest python project to date.  I used tkinter to make the UI and sqlite3 to create and store formatted data into a local database.
The local database was made for viewing the all transfers done with keys defined by timestamp.  The database also stores the filenames from the 
transfer selected to be viewed in the right-most treeview window.  The program uses the stat, os, datetime, time, and shutil modules as well
for the transfer and database storage.  I have been testing the accuracy and adding database transfer entries to the program to find bugs.  
None have been found.  Thanks for checking it out!  And I appreciate reporting any bugs found.
